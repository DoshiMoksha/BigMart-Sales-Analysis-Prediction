## BigMart-Sales-Analysis-Prediction

# Project Overview
Welcome to the Big Mart Sales Analysis & Prediction project! This initiative aims to unravel the intricate patterns within sales data for the year 2013, encompassing a diverse array of 1559 products across 10 stores situated in different cities. By leveraging advanced analytics, our goal is to gain profound insights into how various properties of both products and stores significantly influence and contribute to the overall sales landscape.

# Key Objectives
Store Characteristics Analysis:
Store Type Impact: Investigate the correlation between store size and sales, postulating that larger stores may attract higher sales due to the convenience of one-stop shopping.
Product Characteristics Analysis:
Product Visibility: Examine how the positioning of products within a store affects sales. We hypothesize that products strategically placed, especially near the entrance, garner more attention and contribute to increased sales.

Product Price Influence: Explore the relationship between product prices and sales, recognizing that pricing plays a pivotal role in shaping consumer purchasing decisions.

# Hypotheses
Store Characteristics Hypothesis:

Larger stores (identified by specific characteristics) are expected to yield higher sales due to the convenience they offer to customers seeking a comprehensive shopping experience.
Product Characteristics Hypotheses:

Products strategically placed for higher visibility within a store are anticipated to exhibit increased sales compared to those with lower visibility.

Product pricing is anticipated to have a substantial impact on sales, with lower prices likely driving higher sales volumes.

# Methodology
We will employ data analysis and machine learning techniques to validate these hypotheses, utilizing the provided dataset to train predictive models. Our predictive model aims to offer insights into potential sales outcomes based on varying store and product characteristics.

# Why This Matters
Understanding the intricate dynamics between store and product attributes and their influence on sales is pivotal for optimizing retail strategies. By deciphering these patterns, businesses can make informed decisions, enhancing the shopping experience for customers while maximizing sales revenue.
